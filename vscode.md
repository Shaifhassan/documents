### Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view and install the following extension:

   - **Name:** [Oracle Developer Tools for VS Code (SQL and PLSQL)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Oracle.oracledevtools)
   - **ID:** Oracle.oracledevtools
   - **Description:** Develop SQL and PL/SQL with Oracle Database and Oracle Autonomous Database
   - **Version:** 23.4.0
   - **Publisher:** Oracle Corporation

For a comprehensive guide on getting started, visit the [Oracle Developer Tools for VS Code Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/developer-tools-for-vscode/getting-started/index.html).

### Connecting to the Database

Once the extension is installed and Visual Studio Code is restarted, a new `Oracle Explorer` will be available. To connect to the database:

1. In the Oracle Explorer, click the plus (+) sign next to the database.

#### Connecting Using Host Name/IP Address and Service Name

- **Connection Type:** Basic (Host, Port, Service Name)
- **Database Host Name:** Opera DB server IP or Hostname
- **Port Number:** Typically `1521`
- **Service Name:** The database service name, usually `OPERA`
- **Role:** Default (for ordinary use) or SYSDBA (for DBA tasks like creating a user)
- **Username:** Enter the username and password for the Opera schema.
- **Save Password:** Check this box if you do not wish to enter the password each time.
- **Connection Name:** Provide a connection name for reference in Database Explorer and elsewhere.

Click the "Create Connection" button.

_Note: Connection information and settings can be stored at the User, Workspace, or Folder level. For more details, see the documentation on [Organizing Connections](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/developer-tools-for-vscode/getting-started/organizing-connections.html)._

#### Connecting Using TNSNAMES.ORA File

If you have an Oracle client installed, you can use a `tnsnames.ora` file:

1. Copy the `tnsnames.ora` file into the directory set as the Config Files Folder in the Oracle Developer Tools for VS Code Extension Settings. By default, this location is `~/Oracle/network/admin` on Linux and Mac, and `%USERPROFILE%\Oracle\network\admin` on Windows.
2. If you need to create a `tnsnames.ora` file, refer to the sample located at `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions\oracle.oracledevtools-<version>\sample\network` on Windows.

For example:

```sql
OPERA = (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = `Host Name / IP Address`)(PORT = 1521))
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = OPERA)
  )
)
```

If using Oracle Database 11g, additional configuration is required to change the TNS authentication protocol. Follow the steps to modify both client and server settings to avoid the error: [ORA-28040: The database does not accept your client's authentication protocol; login denied.](https://docs.oracle.com/en/error-help/db/ora-28040/?r=23ai)

Add the following lines to `sqlnet.ora`:

```ini
SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES=(NONE)
SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_CLIENT = 8
SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER = 8
```

Repeat this process on the database server (files are typically located in `D:\ORACLE\11204\NETWORK\ADMIN` on Windows).

### Running Queries

1. Go to the Oracle Explorer and connect to the database.
2. Right-click the database and select "Set as Default Connection". The default database connection will have an (\*) flag.
3. To run a query or script, open a new SQL file or create one in your project explorer.
4. Write your query, such as:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM resort;
   ```

5. Click the "Execute SQL" button (play icon) to run the query. Results can be exported to `CSV` or `JSON`.

### Debugging

The extension includes an inbuilt debugger similar to SQL Developer but with enhanced features from VS Code.

#### Debugging Methods

1. **Simple Debug:** Right-click any function or procedure and select "Debug". Input the required values when prompted.
2. **External Remote Debugger:** Allows you to write and execute custom scripts.

To enable debugging, ensure that the client PC is added to the database network ACL protocols. Without this, the database will not be able to remote debug using `SYS.DBMS_DEBUG_JDWP`.

For the default database connection, set your PC's IP address under `PL/SQL Debugger Settings` in the Oracle Explorer.

For Oracle Database 12c and above:

```sql
-- Connect as SYSDBA
CONNECT sys/<password>@<datasource> AS sysdba;

-- Grant debug privileges to user
GRANT DEBUG CONNECT SESSION TO <username>; -- usually OPERA
GRANT DEBUG ANY PROCEDURE TO <username>; -- usually OPERA

-- Set up ACL
BEGIN
  DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN.APPEND_HOST_ACE(
    HOST => '<hostname/ip address>', -- your IP address or * to allow all
    LOWER_PORT => <starting port number>, -- from VS Code or NULL for all ports
    UPPER_PORT => <ending port number>, -- from VS Code or NULL for all ports
    ACE => XS$ACE_TYPE(PRIVILEGE_LIST => XS$NAME_LIST('jdwp'),
      PRINCIPAL_NAME => '<username>', -- usually OPERA
      PRINCIPAL_TYPE => XS_ACL.PTYPE_DB)
  );
END;
/
```

For Oracle Database 11g, refer to [this solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65541172/network-access-denied-at-sys-dbms-debug-jdwp) for detailed ACL setup.

```sql
-- Connect as SYSDBA
CONNECT sys/<password>@<datasource> AS sysdba;

-- Grant debug privileges to user
GRANT DEBUG CONNECT SESSION TO <username>; -- usually OPERA
GRANT DEBUG ANY PROCEDURE TO <username>; -- usually OPERA

-- Set up ACL

BEGIN
    DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN.CREATE_ACL (
        ACL => 'vscode.xml',
        DESCRIPTION => 'TCP, SMTP, MAIL, HTTP Access',
        PRINCIPAL => 'OPERA',
        IS_GRANT => TRUE,
        PRIVILEGE => 'connect',
        START_DATE => NULL,
        END_DATE => NULL
    );
END;
/

BEGIN
    DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN.ASSIGN_ACL (
        ACL => 'vscode.xml',
        HOST => '*',
        LOWER_PORT => NULL,
        UPPER_PORT => NULL
    );
END;
/

BEGIN

    -- OPERA
    DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN.ADD_PRIVILEGE (
        ACL => 'vscode.xml',
        PRINCIPAL => 'OPERA',
        IS_GRANT => TRUE,
        PRIVILEGE => 'connect',
        START_DATE => NULL,
        END_DATE => NULL
    );
    DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN.ADD_PRIVILEGE (
        ACL => 'vscode.xml',
        PRINCIPAL => 'OPERA',
        IS_GRANT => TRUE,
        PRIVILEGE => 'resolve',
        START_DATE => NULL,
        END_DATE => NULL
    );

END;
/
```
